# Grok in the Box

**Grok in the Box** is a community AI project created by **Rodney Harris** in **Carcar City, Cebu**.  
It explores how local, affordable devices like Raspberry Pi 5 and Jetson Orin can work together to build a distributed, human-centered intelligence network.

## 💡 Mission
To make AI personal, teachable, and creative — a system that grows through empathy, reflection, and collaboration.
